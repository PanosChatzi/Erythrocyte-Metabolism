# Erythrocyte Metabolism

This repository corresponds to our review paper titled "**Erythrocyte metabolism**", which has been published in *Acta Physiologica* (<https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/apha.14081>). Custom scripts were written to construct models of oxygen dissociation, total blood oxygen capacity, and blood transit time in capillaries, based on established mathematical models in the literature. The model was also integrated into a Shiny app, allowing for dynamic exploration and effective communication of the findings.

### Repository structure

The 'code' folder contains the R scripts developed to model the hemoglobin oxygen dissociation curve, oxygen saturation, blood oxygen concentration and capillary transit time.

The 'data' folder contains the data used to create the figures or mathematical examples in the text. Data were extracted using WebPlotDigitizer and/or simulated from the custom scripts.

The 'simulations' folder contains the scripts used to perform quantitative simulations for the paper and figures.
